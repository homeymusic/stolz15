Periodicity, also known as harmonicity, 
is an important predictor of a chord's consonance.
This package implements Stolzenburg's (2015) algorithm
for quantifying a chord's periodicity.

## Installation 

You can install this package from GitHub:

```r
if (!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pmcharrison/stolz15")
```

## Example usage

Higher model outputs correspond to greater period lengths
and hence lower periodicity.
A major chord therefore produces a lower score than a diminished chord:

```{r}
library(stolz15)

smooth_log_periodicity(c(60, 64, 67))
smooth_log_periodicity(c(60, 63, 66))
```
